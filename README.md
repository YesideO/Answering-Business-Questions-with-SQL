# Answering-Business-Questions-with-SQL
The purpose of this project is to query data found in a fictitious music store's database and answer business questions. 
Here are some of the important questions I answered in this project:
- What genres sell best in the U.S?
- Which Sales Rep has the highest number of sales?
- Which country has the highest number of customers and which has the highest sales value?
- Which is better -- selling full albums or individual tracks?
